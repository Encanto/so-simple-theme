# Encanto Squared Engineering Site

This is the Engineering Site for Encanto Squared.

This site is based on the **So Simple Theme**, the followup to [**Minimal Mistakes**](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) -- by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).

This site was created based on the new site steps in the [installation instructions](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/theme-setup/#installation).

Our forked so-simple-theme is at [Encanto/so-simple-theme](https://github.com/Encanto/so-simple-theme).

## Common Commands

To build & serve the site locally:

    bundle exec jekyll serve
